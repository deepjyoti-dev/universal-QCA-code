# universal-QCA-code
universal QCA generator with python
This tool will let you:

Drag-and-drop logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR)

Draw wires interactively connecting gates and cells

Simulate polarization propagation in real-time

Visualize outputs dynamically

Export the design to a graphical QCA diagram or Python simulation code
